<h1> My life story</h1>

	<h2> Birth </h2>
		<p> I was born on Republic day of India in a very rural area called Mainpat in central India. It was January 26th 1990 and early in the morning when the celebration parade was being shown live on the black and white television. Our neighbors have gathered at our house to get a glimpse of the parade from the capital city of Delhi in the north. The Television was probably our only connection to the outside world. There were no phones at our home. I learn about details of my birth through parents and my relatives. 
		</p>

	<h2> Childhood </h2>
		<h3> India </h3>
			<p>Growing up India. I had a pretty interesting childhood. I realized now that I had the privilege of growing up in a such a diverse country, linguistically, ethnically and religiously. I went to school in northern India, near Dharamsala. It's one night bus ride away from New Delhi. I went to Tibetan boarding school in Dharamsala, called Tibetan Children's Village or TCV school.</p>
			
	<h2> Immigration </h2>
		<h3> Teenage years </h3>
			<p> I immigrate to this country in 2002. I remembered the month, March, because I remember it being cold when I was arrived in this country. My first exposure to America was seeing the skycrapers of Chicago as we left Ohare Aiport for Madison.</p>
			
			<p>I made the journey with my younger brother and my dad. Mom was getting ready for us at home in Madison. It will be the first time that I will remember of us being together for more than couple months together. Because when I was five or six, my dad then my mom later immigrated to U.S. to earn a living. It wasn't until six years later when I was twelve that I was able to join them. But my dad came during the summer once a year to visit us. </p>
			
			<p>My younger brother and I, we started school right away. I started at six grade at Sherman Middle school. My brother started in fifth grade at Emerson Elementary school. It took me a while to get adjusted to life in America. This strange culture with its foreign people and often I felt like a foreigner.</p>
