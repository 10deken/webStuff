The :active CSS pseudo-class matches when an element is being activated by the user. 
It allows the page to give a feedback that the activation has been detected by the browser. 
When interacting with a mouse, this is typically the time between the user presses the mouse button and releases it. 
The :active pseudo-class is also typically matched when using the keyboard tab key. It is frequently used on &#60 a &#62 and 
&#60button&#62 HTML elements, but may not be limited to just those. This style may be overridden by any other link-related 
pseudo-classes, that is :link, :hover, and :visited, appearing in subsequent rules. In order to style appropriately 
links, you need to put the :active rule after all the other link-related rules, as defined by the 
LVHA-order: :link — :visited — :hover — :active.
